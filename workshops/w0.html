# Introduction

---

# The Command Line 

## Grammar and Syntax

```bash
verb -adjective -adjective noun noun
```

Adjectives are typically optional

First noun is generally the source of a command
Second noun is usually the target of a command

Sometimes you only use verbs, or one noun, it varies.

---

# The Command Line 

## Basic


```bash
cd /absolute/path/you/want 
cd relative/path/you/want
```
-- change directory  

```bash
ls
ls path/you/want
```
-- look stuff?

```bash
man cd
man ls
```
-- manual / help

```bash
pwd
```
-- present working directory

---

# The Command Line 

## Basic II

```bash
mkdir new_folder
mkdir much_cooler_name_than_new_folder
```
-- make directory
```bash
rm stupid_file_i_dont_need_anymore 
```
-- remove something
```bash
wc
```
-- word count 
```bash
head
```
-- print first bit of something 

---

# The Command Line 

## Basic III

```bash
tail
```
-- print last bit of something 

```bash
cp
```
-- copy something 

```bash
mv
```
-- move something 

---
# The Command Line
## Intermediate

```bash
grep -r 'text you need  to find' .
```
-- search for text

The pipe operator 
```bash
|
```
allows you to chain commands together, to pipe the output of one command to another

```bash
ls file_location | wc -l
grep -r '2015-08-24' . | head
```

```bash
sudo mdkir /some/root/level/permissions/directory
sudo su
```
-- run as a command as super user or become super user

---

# Version Control 

Workflow
```bash
git pull
```
Get most up to date version of the code
Then make changes to the code that you want to 

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit
git push
```

Submit Pull Request
Tag your reviewer with @their_github_handle

---
# Interactive Session I

+ Make a directory in your user home /Users/[your_username] called workspace or something similar
+ cd into this directory
+ use pwd to output the location you're in

+ use git clone to clone a fork of the l2c repository into this location
+ edit the roster.txt file to include your name
+ check the git status
+ add these changes
+ commit these changes
+ push these changes

+ submit a pull request

+ help others when you're done and your PR has been merged

---
# Interactive Session I

Answer these questions programatically:

How many lines (presumably each line is a person) are in the roster.txt file?

What are the names of all the people who have an 'n' in their name in the roster.txt file?

Does the python directory make use of a libarary called pandas?


---
# Language of the Internet 
## JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

```json
  {
  "name" : "Nathan",
  "age"  : 33,
  "favorite_color" : "blue, no green...ahhhhh"
  }
```

Or more generically:
```json
  {
  "key" : "value",
  "key2"  : "value2"
  }
```

---
# Language of the Internet 
## JSON - default data structure of the internet 

Also supports deep nested structures:

```json
  {
  "league" : "NFL",
  "team"  : "Broncos",
  "roster" : {
              "QB" : [ "Peyton Manning", "Some other guy"],
              "WR" : [ "Rod Smith", "Erik Decker", "Ed Macafree"] 
              },
  "ranking": 7
  }
```
---
# Language of the Internet 
## RESTful API (Application Programming Interface)

Base URL
```http
http://www.khanacademy.org/api/v1/
```
+
endpoint
```http
exercises
```
makes up and api call

```http
http://www.khanacademy.org/api/v1/exercises
```

save to a file with 
```bash
curl http://www.khanacademy.org/api/v1/exercises > exercises.json
```

Also can paste url in a browser

---
# Language of the Internet 
## HTTP codes

200s - Yay everything is good, successful call 
400s - Something went wrong:
+ 403: Forbidden
+ 404: Not Found
500s - Something went really really wrong (but in a different way), the server did not respond

--- 
# Language of the Internet

Another useful tool - wget
Downloads data at urls
```bash
wget url/you/want/to/download
```

---
# Interactive Session II

Make a couple curl request to an endpoing with an additional -v option
+ make one that you know should succeed and confirm that you got a 200 response
+ make one that you know should fail and see what sort of response you get

Use wget to download a website and then insepct the contents of the file

---

# Jira / Scrum / Agile 

Project Management

+ Tradeoffs

+ Vocabulary


---

# Interactive Session III

+ Grab a ticket in Jira (from the intro epic) 
+ assign it to yourself
+ move the ticket to in progress
+ write code that completes the acceptance criteria
+ commit your code, submit a PR, get someone to review your code
+ once your code is merged, move the ticket to done
